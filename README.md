# rust soap test

eventually, i'd like to make a SOAP library for rust. this is an experiment wherein i create and
start the default WCF project in Visual Studio, then attempt to send it messages from rust.

the "samples" directory contains from traces of messages sent to the service from another WCF
client, as well as the generated WSDL from the service.
